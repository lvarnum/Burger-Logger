# Burger-Logger  

## Project Description  
The project is designed to allow for a virtual burger enjoyment experience. Any burger can be added to the available burgers that will later be eaten. All burgers that have been eaten will remain logged. It is a good way to keep track of all the burgers a perosn has eaten or wants to eat.  

## Instructions
Upon loading the application, the user will be presented with a landing page. There is an input box where a burger name can be entered. When the user submits the burger, it will appear below with the option to "Devour" it. If that button is pressed, the burger will move to the right side, indicating it has been eaten. There will then be options to "Remove" the burger, or "Enjoy again". Removing the burger will completely delete it from the log. Enjoying it again will push the burger back to the left side where it can be devoured once more.
